# My Dearest Shreya,

Every heartbeat whispers your name. 💕 From the moment I met you, my world changed forever.

## Our Beautiful Moments
- That first coffee date when we laughed till our cheeks hurt
- The rainy day we danced under the umbrella  
- Stargazing when you said you'd love me forever

You're my sunshine, my safe place, my everything. This Valentine's Day, I promise to love you more fiercely than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow.

**Forever yours,**  
**Your Secret Admirer 💌**
