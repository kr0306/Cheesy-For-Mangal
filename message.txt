My dearest Shreya,
<br>
Today felt like the right day to write this —
because it’s your birthday, and because Valentine’s is around the corner,
but mostly because I didn’t want to wait to tell you how much you mean to me.
<bbr>
You’re my everything baby, my best friend, my safe place, and my favourite person.
I hope this day and very other day reminds you of how loved you are, even on the days you forget it.
<br>
Mujhe pata hain ki i may not always say things perfectly, or be the most romantic guy in the room,
but please know this — I love you more than words ever manage to explain.
<br>
Today is about celebrating you.
And every day after this… I’m still yours.(till the 15th)
<br>
Always,
Karun
