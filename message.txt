<p>My dearest Shreya,</p>

<p>
Today felt like the right day to write this —
because it’s your birthday, and because Valentine’s is around the corner,
but mostly because I didn’t want to wait to tell you how much you mean to me.
</p>

<p>
You’re my everything baby, my best friend, my safe place, and my favourite person.
I hope this day and every other day reminds you of how loved you are,
even on the days you forget it.
</p>

<p>
Mujhe pata hai ki I may not always say things perfectly,
or be the most romantic guy in the room,
but please know this — I love you more than words ever manage to explain.
</p>

<p>
Today is about celebrating you.<br>
And every day after this… I’m still yours. (till the 15th)
</p>

<p>
Always,<br>
Karun
</p>
